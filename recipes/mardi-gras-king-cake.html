    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The tradition of the king cake dates back to the Middle Ages. It was originally<br>
        made to celebrate the Catholic Epiphany, a.k.a. Three Kings Day. French settlers<br>
        brought the cake (and the traditions behind it) to Louisiana in the 1800s. So<br>
        what's the meaning behind the baby?<br>
        Some say the tiny token represents the Baby Jesus, while others believe it comes<br>
        from another Louisiana tradition of hiding a bean or trinket in one slice of cake<br>
        during the king's ball — whoever found the trinket would be crowned the "king" or<br>
        "queen" of the ball. Regardless of its origins, the baby is said to bring good<br>
        luck and prosperity.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sweet Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 plastic baby dolls</li>
        <li>purple, green, and gold sanding sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the dough: Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often,<br>
            until steaming and small bubbles form around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove from<br>
            heat and stir in butter until melted and fully combined, about 2 minutes. Allow<br>
            mixture to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a large<br>
            bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooled milk mixture, eggs, salt, nutmeg, and remaining 7 tablespoons sugar to<br>
            yeast mixture, whisk until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Beat flour into yeast mixture, 1 cup at a time, with an electric mixer fitted with<br>
            dough hook attachment on medium speed until dough comes together, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,<br>
            adding additional flour as needed, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled large bowl; turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth or<br>
            plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 ½ hours. When<br>
            risen, punch down and divide dough in half.</li>
        <li>Return dough to a lightly floured work surface, roll out each half into a 10x16-inch<br>
            rectangle, dusting work surface and rolling pin with additional flour if needed.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Combine brown sugar, pecans, flour, raisins, and cinnamon in a<br>
            medium bowl. Pour melted butter on top and mix until crumbly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle filling evenly over dough, about 1 cup per cake, using your hands or a<br>
            spatula to press into dough.</li>
        <li>Starting at one of the long ends, roll each dough rectangle into a tight log.</li>
        <li>Bring the ends of each roll together, pinching the seams together to form 2 individual<br>
            oval-shaped rings. Transfer each ring, seam side down, onto a large rimmed baking<br>
            sheet lined with parchment. With scissors, make cuts 1/3 of the way through the rings<br>
            at 1-inch intervals.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in<br>
            size, 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake both rings in the preheated oven in the upper and lower thirds until golden<br>
            brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean, or when a thermometer inserted into<br>
            the center of the dough reads 190 F, about 25 minutes, rotating sheet trays 180<br>
            degrees and top to bottom, halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Some<br>
            filling might leak out during baking.</li>
        <li>Remove cakes and carefully push 1 doll into bottom of each warm cake. Let cool<br>
            slightly, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>To make the glaze: Whisk confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons water together in a<br>
            small bowl until smooth, adding another 1 tablespoon water if needed to reach desired<br>
            consistency.</li>
        <li>Spread glaze evenly over the tops of both warm cakes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sanding sugar immediately over glaze if desired.</li>
    </ol>
